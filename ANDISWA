## 1. What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters into sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`). Each letter or numeral is represented by a unique combination of these signals. It was one of the earliest forms of digital communication and was primarily used in radio communication, aviation, military, and maritime signaling.

## 2. Historical Background
Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail to be used with the electric telegraph system. Its creation addressed the need for a standardized, simple, and effective long-distance communication system. Over time, international Morse code was adapted and refined from the original version. It played a crucial role during wars and in early wireless communication before the invention of the telephone and internet.

## 3. How Morse Code Works
Morse code uses combinations of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. For example:
- A = `.-`
- B = `-...`
- C = `-.-.`
- 1 = `.----`
- 9 = `----.`

Each symbol is separated by short pauses (silence), and words are separated by longer pauses. This binary-like system makes it suitable for both sound-based and visual communication (e.g., flashing lights or beeps).
